                <h2>git init </h2>
                <p>The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a 
                Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized 
                repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project

                Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory, which contains all of the necessary 
                Git metadata for the new repository. This metadata includes subdirectories for objects, refs, and template files. 
                A HEAD file is also created which points to the currently checked out commit.</p>

        <div id = "tasaus">
            <h2>git remote add origin https://github.com/taunojokinen/WebViikk01.git</h2>
                <p>To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.
                The git remote add command takes two arguments:
                 A unique remote name, for example, “my_awesome_new_remote_repo”
                A remote URL, which you can find on the Source sub-tab of your Git repo</p>

        <div id = "tasaus">
            <h2>git add .</h2>
            <p>When working in Git, or other version control systems, the concept of "saving" is a more nuanced process than saving 
            in a word processor or other traditional file editing applications. The traditional software expression of "saving" 
            is synonymous with the Git term "committing". A commit is the Git equivalent of a "save". Traditional saving should 
            be thought of as a file system operation that is used to overwrite an existing file or write a new file. Alternatively,
            Git committing is an operation that acts upon a collection of files and directories.</p>
        </div>
        <div id = "tasaus">
            <h2>git commit - m "message" .</h2>
            A shortcut command that immediately creates a commit with a passed commit message. By default, git commit will open up 
            the locally configured text editor, and prompt for a commit message to be entered. Passing the -m option will forgo the 
            text editor prompt in-favor of an inline message.

        <div id = "tasaus">
            <h2>git status</h2>
            <p>The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes 
            have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any 
            information regarding the committed project history.</p>
        </div>
        <div id = "tasaus">
            <h2>git push -u origin main</h2>
            <p>git push origin is a git command that pushes a local branch(es) to a remote repository (origin). origin is the 
            conventional shorthand name of the url for the remote repository (usually in GitHub or another cloud git repository provider) 
            for your project.
        <BR>
        -u, or --set-upstream:
        This creates a remote branch and sets it upstream of the current branch you are pushing. The relationship between the current 
        branch and upstream branch is remembered, such that you will not have to continually connect the remote and local branches 
        when pushing commits.</p>
